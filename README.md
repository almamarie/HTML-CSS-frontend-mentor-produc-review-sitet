## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Eventhough I took 2 hours to complete the project, the most difficult part for me was centering the element in the middle of the body. I am grateful that I have been able to resolve this and I now know how to properly center elements with html and css.
